# WiDS: Stock Price Prediction Using Reinforcement Learning

This repository contains the full project developed for the **Winter in Data Science (WiDS)** program. It explores the application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) across two distinct environments: a simulated physics task and financial market prediction.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into two primary folders representing different phases of the project:

* **`Midterm Submission/`**: Focused on solving the **Lunar Lander** environment using Deep Q-Networks (DQN).
* **`Stock_Price_Prediction/`**: The final project phase applying **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** to Nifty 50 stock data.

## Project Overview

### Midterm: Lunar Lander
The midterm assignment involved training an agent to land a spacecraft safely using:
* **Algorithms**: DQN and DDQN (Double Deep Q-Networks).
* **Network**: A 4-layer feedforward neural network (1 input, 2 hidden, 1 output layer).
* **Environment**: OpenAI Gym Lunar Lander.

### Final Project: Stock Market Prediction
The final phase transitioned to quantitative finance by building an RL-based trading agent:
* **Data**: Historical Nifty 50 stock data from 2010 to 2019.
* **Model**: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).
* **Goal**: Automate Buy/Sell/Hold decisions to maximize cumulative portfolio returns.
